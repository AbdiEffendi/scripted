This is the zen coding library (renamed emmet).  Commit is https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/c8583d5195f47a91ba86a0dc57c2229532bc36ad

Checked out code and ran `ant plugin.generic-full`. This produces emmet-full.js and emmet-fu.min.js.

For a distribution, consider including only the minified form of emmet.
