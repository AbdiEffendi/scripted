		<td class="title">Editor update and new features</td>
		<td class="description">
		Scripted 0.4 has moved from an orion editor dated Feb 2012 to an editor dated Jan 2013 (version 20130123-1139). This gives Scripted
		theming capabilities and also provides new facilities like a line wrapping mode and the ability to show whitespace.
		These new actions are listed in the help: 
		'<span class="code">Toggle Visible Whitespace</span>' and '<span class="code">Toggle Wrap Mode</span>'. Bind these actions to
		a key if you want to try them out. (Any keys you bind will be persisted in your <span class="code">USER_HOME/.scriptedrc/keymap-*.json</span>)
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr id="font_configuration">
		<td class="title">More font size configuration</td>
		<td class="description">
		Previously the font size could only be set for the editor. It can now be set for the breadcrumb, navigator and help panel.
		The configuration options are:
<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock">{
    ui: {
        font_size_breadcrumb: 16,
        font_size_nav: 16,
        font_size_help: 14
    }
}
</span></div>

	<tr id="async">
		<td class="title">More asynchronicity</td>
		<td class="description">
		Some more of the editor behaviour has been made asynchronous thanks to a contribution from <a href="https://github.com/tgeorgiev">Tony Georgiev</a>. This
		means you get into a position where you can edit your code even faster.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr id="livereload">
		<td class="title">Integrated server (with livereload)</td>
		<td class="description">
		On the toolbar is a new 'play' icon. When pressed this will launch a small server that 'serves' the content of the project
		currently being edited. The project is served at <span class="code">http://localhost:8000</span>. After pressing 'play' the button will change to a
		'stop' icon which will stop the server when pressed.  If you wish to serve a directory other then the project root, you can set
		the webroot in the config file:
<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock">{
    application: {
        webroot: "client" // project subfolder
    }
}
</span></div>
		The server that is launched actually includes some basic livereload integration. To exploit this you (currently) need to include
		the following script snippet in your html:

<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock"> &lt;script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</span></div>

		With that in place, the app available on localhost:8000 will be live reloading, this means it will notice css file changes and
		dynamically update them on the page you are viewing. It will notice changes to js files but those will trigger a page reload.

		appropriately indented on the next line. When the block is closed
		with a <span class="code">}</span> and <span class="code">ENTER</span> pressed again, that will be
		automatically unindented. This is not a sophisticated implementation at the
        moment, please raise issues for any problems you see. If whatever problems you hit with it become too irritating,
		use the following config options to turn it off!
<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock">{

    <tr id="templates">
		<td class="title">Code template improvements</td>
		<td class="description">
		We have improved code templates and snippets in Scripted.  From an end user's point of view, you can select a word in 
		a JavaScript or HTML file and surround the word with some text.  For example, in a JavaScript file, you can make a selection and press CTRL+Space:
		
		<center>
			<img src="template1.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		When you make a selection, the text is surrounded by the text with appropriate indentation:
		
		<center>
			<img src="template2.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		This also works in HTML files, where there are many built-in templates:
		
		<center>
			<img src="template3.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		And choose the <tt>a</tt> template:
		
		<center>
			<img src="template4.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		For more information, including instructions on how to author your own templates, see our 
		<a href="http://blog.springsource.org/2013/01/22/simple-templates-for-the-scripted-editor/">blog post on it</a>.

		Hovers on function and variable references and declarations now include JSDoc. A declaration with simple JSDoc attached to it will look like this:
		<center>
			<img src="jsdoc2.png" border="1" />

		And if you have a function, then all of the JSDoc tags will be displayed appropriately.

		<tt>performOperation</tt> function:
		<center>
			<img src="jsdoc3.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		The signature says that the function takes 3 arguments and returns a number. The first two are numbers and the third is an object with a <tt>doit</tt> property that is
		a function that itself takes two numbers as arguments and returns a number.

		<a href="http://emmet.io">Emmet (also called Zen Coding)</a> is an editor plugin that supports a greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.  Scripted now has Emmet support in the editor.
		The key bindings for Emmet commands are Ctrl+Shift+n, where <em>n</em> is a number from 1-9.  See the complete bindings in the help panel (open by pressing <em>F1</em>)
		<center>
			<img src="zen_help_panel.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		The Emmet support provides many features.  One of them is expanding snippets into proper HTML.  So, pressing Ctrl+Shift+1 on the following selection:
		<center>
			<img src="zen_pre_expand.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		will expand the selection into this:
		<center>
			<img src="zen_post_expand.png" border="1" />

		Scripted's client-side app can now be extended via plugins written in JavaScript.
		<p>
		A Scripted plugin is a JavaScript AMD module that gets loaded dynamically by the Scripted client app if
		it is found in 'the right place'. Scripted 0.4. will look for plugins in two different places. a) '~/.scriptedrc/plugins' folder and b) the
		'plugins' folder inside the Scripted distribution itself.</p>
		<p>
		A Scripted plugin is a 'first-class' citizen in the Scripted client app. It is just an AMD module, like any other client-side module 
		in the Scripted code base. As such, a plugin can essentially do anything that any other client-side Scripted code can do. However
		as internal APIs are unstable and are not typically well-documented nor easy to use, a growing set of clean and stable public 
		APIs are being developed. These APIs are designed specifically to make it easy to implement certain kinds functionality as plugins.</p>
		<p>
		Currently we already have APIs to support the following kinds of things:</p>
		<ul>
		   <li>Transform the text in the editor before a save (e.g. remove trailing whitespace)</li>
		   <li>Define actions and keybindings. The actions can interact with the editor and do things like change the editor contents, move the
		       cursor, change the selection, etc. As an example Zencoding support is implemented as a plugin.</lo>
		   <li>Create gutter annotations. The Scripted editor shows information such as JavaScript Syntax Errors or Jshint Warnings by annotating
		       the text in the editor. An annotation is like a text snippet attached to a specific region of text in the editor. It is shown by styling 
		       the region differently as well as adding corresponding visual cues in the right and left margins of the editor. Via this API it is 
		       easy for a plugin to contribute their own anotations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The plugin architecture and APIs are a work in progress. We envision that the APIs will grow  and may still evolve as we strive to support 
		more use cases. Do you have something you'd like to add to Scripted as a plugin? The current APIs don't work for you, 
		or you find them too hard to use? We would like to <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/issues">hear from you</a>!</p>
		<p>
		More details about the plugin-architecture and APIs can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/wiki/Plugins">Scripted Wiki</a>.</p>

		<p>
		Various fixes have been included that improve the behaviour of the navigator context menu, and include:</p>
		<ul>
		   <li>Right-click on a navigator element now highlights the selection so that it is clear what the context is. Unlike left-click selection, right-clicking on a directory will not exapnd it, only select it.</li>
		   <li>When invoking the context menu towards the bottom of the navigator, the context menu is now positioned to the immediate top of the mouse click location. If sufficient space exists below
		   the mouse click location, the context menu will continue to be shown beneath it.</li>
		   <li>Fixed issues with the navigator not properly refreshing after deleting or renaming a navigator element, where the containing parent used to be in a collapsed state. Now the parent directory retains its expanded state. 
		   </li>
		   <li>Navigating to hidden elements that would otherwise require manual scrolling to make them visible now automatically scrolls them to the centre of the visible area in the navigator.</li>
		   <li>In certain cases, invoking the context menu used to automatically select the first context menu action. This has been fixed as well for 0.4 </li>
