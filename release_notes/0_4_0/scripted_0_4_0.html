		<td class="title">Editor update and new features</td>
		<td class="description">
		Scripted 0.4 has upgraded an Orion editor from Jan 2013 (version 20130123-1139). This gives Scripted
		theming capabilities and also provides new facilities like a line wrapping mode and the ability to show whitespace.
		These new actions are listed in the help: 
		'<span class="code">Toggle Visible Whitespace</span>' and '<span class="code">Toggle Wrap Mode</span>'. Bind these actions to
		a key if you want to try them out. (Any keys you bind will be persisted in your <span class="code">USER_HOME/.scriptedrc/keymap-*.json</span>)
		</td>
	</tr>


    <tr id="templates">
		<td class="title">Code template improvements</td>
		<td class="description">
		We have improved code templates and snippets in Scripted.  From an end user's point of view, you can select a word in 
		a JavaScript or HTML file and surround the word with some text.  For example, in a JavaScript file, you can make a selection and
		press <span class="kb">CTRL+Space</span>:
		
		<center>
			<img src="templates1.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		When you make a selection, the text is surrounded by the text with appropriate indentation:
		
		<center>
			<img src="templates2.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		This also works in HTML files, where there are many built-in templates:
		
		<center>
			<img src="templates3.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		And choose the '<span class="code">a</span>' template:
		
		<center>
			<img src="templates4.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		For more information, including instructions on how to author your own templates, see our 
		<a href="http://blog.springsource.org/2013/01/22/simple-templates-for-the-scripted-editor/">blog post on it</a>.

    <tr id="hover_jsdoc">
		<td class="title">Tooltip hovers now show JSdoc</td>
		<td class="description">
		Hovers on function and variable references and declarations now include JSDoc. A declaration with simple JSDoc attached to it will look like this:
		<center>
			<img src="jsdoc2.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		
		And if you have a function, then all of the JSDoc tags will be displayed appropriately.
		<center>
			<img src="jsdoc1.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		This works across files when references can correctly be resolved by the inferencing engine.

    <tr id="hover_parameter_types">

		<td class="description">
		Hovers on function references and declarations now include the parameter types.  In the following example, you can see the full type signature for the
		<span class="code">performOperation</span> function:
		<center>
			<img src="jsdoc3.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		The signature says that the function takes 3 arguments and returns a number. The first two are numbers and the third is an object with a <tt>doit</tt> property that is
		a function that itself takes two numbers as arguments and returns a number.

		Exploiting the theming support in the latest Orion editor, Scripted now has a dark theme with light text on a dark background.
		The colors within the themes are not configurable at the moment but a toggle is provided in the toolbar at
		the top to switch quickly between dark and light (or press <span class="kb">F3</span>).

	<tr id="auto_indent_unindent">
		<td class="title">Auto indent and unindent</td>

		After entering a <span class="code">{</span> and pressing <span class="kb">ENTER</span> the cursor will be
		appropriately indented on the next line. When the block is closed
		with a <span class="code">}</span> and <span class="kb">ENTER</span> pressed again, that will be
		automatically unindented. This is not a sophisticated implementation at the
        moment, so please raise issues for any problems you see. If whatever problems you hit with it become too irritating,
		use the following config options in your <span class="code">.scripted</span> file to turn it off!
<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock">{
    editor: {
        unindent_after_close_curly: false,

		<a href="http://emmet.io">Emmet (also called Zen Coding)</a> is an editor plugin that supports a greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.  Scripted now has Emmet support in the editor.
		The key bindings for Emmet commands are <span class="kb">Ctrl+Shift+n</span>, where <em>n</em> is a number from 1-9.  See the complete bindings in the help panel (open by pressing <span class="kb">F1</span>)
		<center>
			<img src="zen_help_panel.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		The Emmet support provides many features.  One of them is expanding snippets into proper HTML.  So, pressing <span class="kb">Ctrl+Shift+1</span> on the following selection:
		<center>
			<img src="zen_pre_expand.png" border="1" />
		</center>
		will expand the selection into this:
		<center>
			<img src="zen_post_expand.png" border="1" />

		On the toolbar is a new 'play' icon. When pressed this will launch a small server that 'serves' the content of the project
		currently being edited. The project is served at <span class="code">http://localhost:8000</span>. After pressing 'play' the button will change to a
		'stop' icon which will stop the server when pressed.  If you wish to serve a directory other then the project root, you can set
		the webroot in the config file:
<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock">{
    application: {
        webroot: "client" // project subfolder
    }
}
</span></div>
		The server that is launched actually includes some basic livereload integration. To exploit this you (currently) need to include
		the following script snippet in your html:

<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock"> &lt;script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</span></div>

		With that in place, the app available on localhost:8000 will be live reloading, this means it will notice css file changes and
		dynamically update them on the page you are viewing. It will notice changes to js files but those will trigger a page reload.

    <tr id="plugins">
		<td class="title">Plugins</td>
		<td class="description">
		Scripted's client-side app can now be extended via plugins written in JavaScript.
		<p>
		A Scripted plugin is a JavaScript AMD module that gets loaded dynamically by the Scripted client app if
		it is found in 'the right place'. Scripted 0.4. will look for plugins in two different places. a) '<span class="code">~/.scriptedrc/plugins</span>' folder and b) the
		'<span class="code">plugins</span>' folder inside the Scripted distribution itself.</p>
		<p>
		A Scripted plugin is a 'first-class' citizen in the Scripted client app. It is just an AMD module, like any other client-side module 
		in the Scripted code base. As such, a plugin can essentially do anything that any other client-side Scripted code can do. However
		as internal APIs are unstable and are not typically well-documented nor easy to use, a growing set of clean and stable public 
		APIs are being developed. These APIs are designed specifically to make it easy to implement certain kinds functionality as plugins.</p>
		<p>
		Currently we already have APIs to support the following kinds of things:</p>
		<ul>
		   <li>Transform the text in the editor before a save (e.g. remove trailing whitespace). <br>
			Example: <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/blob/master/plugins/trailing-whitespace-plugin.js">The remove trailing whitespace plugin</a></li>
		   <li>Define actions and keybindings. The actions can interact with the editor and do things like change the editor contents, move the
		       cursor, change the selection, etc. As an example Zencoding support is implemented as a plugin.<br>
				Example: <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/blob/master/plugins/zen-coding-plugin/zen-coding-plugin.js">Zen coding plugin</a></li>
		   <li>Create gutter annotations. The Scripted editor shows information such as JavaScript Syntax Errors or Jshint Warnings by annotating
		       the text in the editor. An annotation is like a text snippet attached to a specific region of text in the editor. It is shown by styling 
		       the region differently as well as adding corresponding visual cues in the right and left margins of the editor. Via this API it is 
		       easy for a plugin to contribute their own annotations.<br>
				Example: <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/blob/master/plugins/annotation-adding-plugin/annotation-adding-plugin.js">Fruit name locator plugin!</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The plugin architecture and APIs are a work in progress. We envision that the APIs will grow  and may still evolve as we strive to support 
		more use cases. Do you have something you'd like to add to Scripted as a plugin? If the current APIs don't work for you, 
		or you find them too hard to use, we would like to <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/issues">hear from you</a>!</p>
		<p>
		More details about the plugin-architecture and APIs can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/wiki/Plugins">Scripted Wiki</a>.
