<td class="title">Enhancements to <b>Open File</b> and <b>Look in Files</b> search dialogs</td>
<td class="description">
   <p>Besides having a new look. These dialogs now perform a dynamic incremental search. A search kicks of as soon
   as enough characters have been typed (0 characters for 'Open File' searches and 3 characters for 'Look in File' 
   searches). As the search is still running you can continue to type and the still executing query is 
   dynamically updated as you type. The backend optimizes dynamic query updates by using the already found results 
   while changing the search-term for the remainder of an ongoing search.</p>

   <p><a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/SCRIPTED-229">Scripted-229</a>: Searches are also automatically paused 
   when the number of displayed results exceeds what can be visibly displayed on-screen. A paused search is

		<td class="title">Inferencing of global dependencies</td>
		<td class="description">Scripted now recognizes a form of global dependencies for JavaScript files.  When a JavaScript file is not deteremined to be an AMD style module or a CommonJS syle module,
		it is considered a global module (i.e., it doesn't use a module system).  For files that have a global module, the Scripted dependency resolver will look for other global modules that it depends on.
		It does this by looking for references to the current JavaScript file in script tags in HTML files. And when a reference is found, Scripted will find all other JavaScript files referenced in that HTML file.
		In order to avoid circular dependencies, only JavaScript files that come before the current file are considered referenced.
		<br/><br/>
		All global variables from referenced files will be available for content assist and navigation in the current JavaScript file.  For example:
		<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/foo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/bar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body/&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
		</pre>
		When editing in <tt>main.js</tt>, you will have access to all global variables defined in both <tt>bar.js</tt> and <tt>foo.js</tt>.  When
		editing <tt>bar.js</tt>, you will have access only to global variables from <tt>foo.js</tt>.  And when in <tt>foo.js</tt>, you will not
		have access to any other global variables.
		<br/><br/>
		Here is a screen shot of performing content assist inside of <tt>main.js</tt> that depends on <tt>bar,js</tt>:
		<br/><br/>
		<img src="global_deps.png" />		
		<br/><br/>
		As you can see, <tt>bar</tt> is available in content assist.  There are two important things to keep in mind here:
		<ol>
		  <li>You must have an HTML file somewhere in a parent directory to gather the JavaScript files.</li>
		  <li>References to identifiers defined in other files will be marked as an error by jshint unless you use the <tt>/*global */</tt> directive.</li>

		You can see examples of scripted-completions files in the scripted/completions folder of your Scripted installation.
		<br/><br/>
		Out of the box, we provide templates for common JavaScript, JQuery, and HTML idioms.  But, you can provide your own templates.
		<br/><br/>
		A full description of the syntax of scripted-completions files are available at the 
		<a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/completions.html">Sublime text documentation</a>.
		Since many of our users will be familiar with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, we provide compatibility
		with their completions files.  If you want to use an existing <em>sublime-completions</em> file, then all you need to do is
		change the file extension and move it to your <tt>.scriptedrc</tt> folder.
		<br/><br/>
		Note that it is possible to place your scripted-completions files in the scripted/completions folder, but this is not recommended
		since they will be lost on upgrades or re-installs.

		The context menu is invoked anywhere in the navigator area by right-clicking on a navigator element like a file or folder. The four context menu options are:
		 <ul><li>
		<b>New File</b>: Creates a new file in either a selected folder, or if a file was selected, in the same parent folder containing that file.
		</li><li>
		<b>New Folder</b>: Creates a new folder in either a selected folder, or if a file was selected, in the same parent folder containing that file.

		<b>Rename</b>: Renames an existing file or folder. If another resource already exists with the new name, the existing resource will be replaced.

		<b>Delete</b>: Deletes a file or folder. For folders, all content of the folders are also deleted.
		</li></ul>
		<p><img src="navigator_context_menu.png" border="1" title="Navigator Context Menu"/></p>
		If right-clicking in an empty space in the navigator, <b>Rename</b> and <b>Delete</b> are disabled, and creating a new file or folder will add the resource at root level.
		<br/><br/>
		Each context menu action opens a modal dialogue that either prompts the user to confirm the operation, as in the case of deleting a resource, or asks the user for input. If an error
		occurs during the resource operation, for example, renaming a folder, an error message is displayed to the user and the dialogue remains open.
		<br/><br/>
