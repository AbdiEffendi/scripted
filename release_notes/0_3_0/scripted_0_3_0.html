		<td class="title">Inferencing of global dependencies</td>
		<td class="description">Scripted now recognizes a form of global dependencies for JavaScript files. 
		When a JavaScript file is not determined to be an AMD style module or a CommonJS syle module, it is
		considered a global module (i.e. it doesn't use a module system).  For files that have a global module,
		the Scripted dependency resolver will look for other global modules that it depends on.
		It does this by looking for references to the current JavaScript file in script tags in HTML files.
		When a reference is found, Scripted will find all other JavaScript files referenced in that HTML file.
		In order to avoid circular dependencies, only JavaScript files that come before the current file are considered referenced.
		<br/><br/>
		All global variables from referenced files will be available for content assist and navigation in the current JavaScript file.  For example:
<div class="codeblockcontainer"><span class="codeblock">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/foo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/bar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body/&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</span></div>
		<br>
		When editing in <tt>main.js</tt>, you will have access to all global variables defined in both <tt>bar.js</tt> and <tt>foo.js</tt>.  When
		editing <tt>bar.js</tt>, you will have access only to global variables from <tt>foo.js</tt>.  And when in <tt>foo.js</tt>, you will not
		have access to any other global variables.
		<br/><br/>
		Here is a screen shot of performing content assist inside of <tt>main.js</tt> that depends on <tt>bar,js</tt>:
		<br/><br/>
		<img src="global_deps.png" />		
		<br/><br/>
		As you can see, <tt>bar</tt> is available in content assist.  There are two important things to keep in mind here:
		<ol>
		  <li>You must have an HTML file somewhere in a parent directory to gather the JavaScript files.</li>
		  <li>References to identifiers defined in other files will be marked as an error by JSHint unless you use the <span class="code">/*global */</span> directive.</li>

		Scripted has moved to using JSHint. Configuration is still possible using the <span class="code">.scripted</span> file but 
		Scripted will also look for a <span class="code">.jshintrc</span> file and use that to configure the linter. Fewer linter options
		are turned on by default in this version, so it is recommended users take a moment to configure their
		linter (through <span class="code">.scripted</span> or <span class="code">.jshintrc</span>) - a sample

		<br/><br/>
		A full description of the syntax of scripted-completions files are available at the 
		<a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/completions.html">Sublime text documentation</a>.
		Since many of our users will be familiar with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, we provide compatibility

		change the file extension and move it to your <span class="code">.scriptedrc</span> folder.

		 <ul><li>
		<em>New File</em>: Creates a new file in either a selected folder, or if a file was selected, in the same parent folder containing that file.
		</li><li>
		<em>New Folder</em>: Creates a new folder in either a selected folder, or if a file was selected, in the same parent folder containing that file.
		</li><li>
		<em>Rename</em>: Renames an existing file or folder. If another resource already exists with the new name, the existing resource will be replaced.
		</li><li>
		<em>Delete</em>: Deletes a file or folder. For folders, all content of the folders are also deleted.
		</li></ul>
		<p><center><img src="navigator_context_menu.png" title="Navigator Context Menu"/></center></p>
		If right-clicking in an empty space in the navigator, <b>Rename</b> and <b>Delete</b> are disabled, and creating a new file or folder will
		add the resource at root level.
		<br/><br/>
		Each context menu action opens a modal dialog that either prompts the user to confirm the operation, as in
		the case of deleting a resource, or asks the user for input. If an error occurs during the resource operation, for
		example, renaming a folder, an error message is displayed to the user and the dialog remains open.
		<br/><br/> 
		Closing the dialogs can be done by either clicking the Cancel button, pressing Esc, or clicking outside the dialogs.
